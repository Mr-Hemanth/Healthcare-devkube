## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### ✅ Browser Extension Errors (Your Current Issue)

**Issue**: `Extension context invalidated` errors in browser console
**Analysis**: These are Chrome extension errors, NOT your application errors
**Solution**: These can be safely ignored - they don't affect your app

**✅ Your App is Working Correctly:**
- API calls are successful (200 responses)
- Login and signup are functioning
- Database operations are working

### ✅ Atlas Connection Issues

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check backend logs: `kubectl logs deployment/healthcare-backend -n healthcare-app`
2. Look for Atlas connection messages
3. Verify environment variables in pod
4. Test Atlas connection string

### ✅ LoadBalancer Access Issues

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check LoadBalancer IP: `kubectl get svc healthcare-frontend-service -n healthcare-app`
2. Use port-forward for testing: `kubectl port-forward service/healthcare-frontend-service 3000:80 -n healthcare-app`
3. Check GCP quotas and billing
